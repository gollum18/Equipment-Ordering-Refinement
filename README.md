# Equipment Ordering and Refinement
A mod for Skyrim SE with the goal of allowing players to custom order and refine equipment at blacksmith vendors. The goal of this mod is to provide an alternative to the Blacksmithing skill.


## Goals
- [] Ordering of a single piece of equipment
- [] Ordering of armor sets
- [] Ordering/refinement based on vendor skill
- [] Ordering takes a certain amount of in-game time based on vendor skill and equipment ordered
- [] Increasing cost based on vendor skill and equipment ordered/refined
- [] Player must provide crafting materials for equipment orders


## Motivation
You may ask: "Why would I need this mod if the blacksmithing skill exists?" or "What is the point of the blacksmithing skill with this mod installed?" 


Back in the ye-olden days of Oldrim when the game first launched, blacksmithing was a viable skill to level up out of the gate (without glitching the game). This was primarily because of two features of Oldrim:
1. Blacksmithing in Oldrim did not possess a diminishing return curve on smithed items and equipment meaning it was entirely possible to level the skill to 100 by just crafting Iron Daggers through slight time investment.
2. The most abundant ore type in Skyrim is iron ore. The only other ore type in Skyrim that is even remotely close to it's abundance is ebony ore, which the player cannot utilize in smithing until they are nearly finished leveling the skill.


Sometime around patch 1.5 for Oldrim, Bethesda decided to do away with static levelling of the Blacksmithing skill and added a diminishing return curve for blacksmithing xp from items and equipment. The intent was obviously to make it feel more rewarding and prevent players from spamming their way to the best equipment as soon as they start the game (usually well before said equipment was available as levelled loot or from vendors). This single change made the blacksmithing skill far more expensive and time-consuming, akin to the same skill in a game like World of Warcraft. Outside of iron ore and ebony ore, the other types of ore are far more precious and rare in the Skyrim game world. Levelling the blacksmithing skill in an updated version of Oldrim or Skyrim SE thus requires purchasing raw materials from vendors at a much higher cost than what was realizable before the patch.


This mod seeks to balance this change by introducing a feature I've always wanted in the game and a feature that it seems Bethesda wanted as well considering the voice acting of the blacksmith vendors: equipment ordering and refinement. The basic premise is to allow players to order equipment and refine it at blacksmiths provided they have the materials and the vendor has the requisite skill. Vendors with higher skill should take less time to produce equipment at a higher cost with the opposite holding true for less skilled vendors. For instance, because crafting dragon equipment takes Master-level skill, only Eorlund Gray-Mane in Whiterun can produce said equipment at a hefty cost as well as a not-insignificant time investment. Of course, equipment that requires the use of a specific forge such as Skyforged equipment should only be orderable at the vendor who would naturally be able to make such equipment.


Note that this mod is meant to be immersive with the Skyrim game world. The prices for the new blacksmith services will eventually be balanced the Skyrim economy.
